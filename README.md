This is the code part of automated complex of measurements of microwave characteristics

The complex is based on two devices, and the program communicates with the devices, monitors their condition and performs all the necessary calculations

When creating, I used the principles of OOP, tried to correctly divide the program into modules, used inheritance

I was creating a program in Microsoft Visual Studio, code is located in the VisualStudioProject/SpinWaveTool/
